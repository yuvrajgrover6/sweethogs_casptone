This suggests the elevated risk is likely driven by her other two diagnoses, the acute reason for her emergency admission, or the complexity of her overall care (10 medications, regimen changed, 30 lab procedures). Focus on robust post-discharge planning, including thorough medication reconciliation and close, multidisciplinary follow-up for all her medical conditions, not just diabetes, to mitigate this elevated readmission risk. Patient education on new medications and symptom monitoring is crucial."
